	project split into 2 sections, core and game
	game is created by main, and contains and intializes core, as well as future game-related stuff such as actor manager
	resources are in the output directory - where the build also builds to, just so its easier to manage lol


TODO:
	ey, may use irrlicht to handle xml instead of tinyxml2, less dependancies lol, its got r/w capabilities in their demo
	subscriber/observer pattern for input, or else doing if(input->waskeypressed(forwardKey)) for every single actor on every single tick would be really taxing, especially when no input's actually going on, https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer/cpp/3
