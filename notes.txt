	project split into 2 sections, core and game
	game is created by main, and contains and intializes core, as well as future game-related stuff such as actor manager
	core should contain stuff 
	resources are in the output directory - where the build also builds to, just so its easier to manage lol
	CTRL+R ON A VAR TO RENAME ALL INSTANCES, neato

	main loop runs
	irrlicht's core namespace has a bunch of neat data types and containers, with some of them offering some pretty good shiz, like bst-like search time complexity for their irr::core::map<T,T> type
	may just use good ol' tinyxml2 for handling xml stuff

	attending events aint fun for github commit counts :(((
	scrap y'old observer pattern lol, this thing isnt going to reach a point where its gonna be super intensive anyway, pfft

3 September 2016
	o boy, september already
	finished up event manager, pretty conventional
	near future:
	timeManager for interfacing with the devices' ITimer, and a fancy OS manager which handles clipboard stuff

TODO:
	subscriber/observer pattern for input, or else doing if(input->waskeypressed(forwardKey)) for every single actor on every single tick would be really taxing, especially when no input's actually going on, https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer/cpp/3
